                <h2>The Evolution of Steam</h2>
                <p> Many indie games found Steam to be the right marketplace for them. Several decades ago, most video games released had to go through a major publisher, such as Sony, Tencent, Nintendo, Electronic Arts, etc. The publisher is the company that arranges for the advertising, promotion, manufacturing, and distribution of the game. Prior to 2005, most games were sold physically and companies would either distribute the games themselves, if they were a large company, or hire a distributor.
                  </p>
                <p>In the early 2000s, however, the rise of online distribution platforms, like Steam, launched a golden age for indie developers and indie games. Steam published, advertised, and updated the games to the player base directly. It did not require indie developers to go through a publisher.
                </p>
                <p>Overtime, however, Steam has become oversaturated with indie games.
                  There are thousands of games being released on Steam every single year,
                  which leads to poor discoverability.
                </p>
                <p>
                The early days of Steam and its being a platform dedicated to indie games are over.

                  As seen in the image, AAA and AA games comprise only 4% of the number of games on Steam
                  but account for 72% of revenue. Although indie games and small indie games make up 96% of the market,
                  the revenue generated by indie games comprises only 28% of the total revenue earned on Steam.
