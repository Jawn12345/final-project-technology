                <h2>Steam's Impact on Developers</h2>
                <p> Steam holds a monopoly over digital distribution. Steam is the leading distributor of digital games for the past 16 years.
                    Steam favors bigger companies, which are typically AAA or AA companies.
                </p>
                <p>“If a game makes more than $10 million,
                  developers get to keep a bigger cut of any extra earnings”
                </p>
                <p>There is a 70/30 revenue split between the developer and Valve.
                  The new Valve policy makes it so that if games make more than $10 million,
                  the split becomes 75/25; if the games make more than $50 million,
                  the split becomes 80/20. The change only benefits bigger companies or developers.
                  In theory, developers are supposed to earn their profits by promoting
                  the game to a bigger audience; however, unpopular games are not favored
                  by the algorithm to begin with.
