                <h2>Who can challenge Steam?</h2>
                <p> Steam holds approximately 75% of the market share for PC games.
                </p>
                <p>They have very, very few competitors. A few notable ones are GOG, Origin, and the Epic Games Store.
                </p>
                <p>The Epic Game Store was created to rival Steam.
                  Epic Games takes a 12% split as opposed to Steamâ€™s 30% split.
                  If the game is made with Unreal Engine, owned by Epic Games,
                  then it is further lowered to 5%.
                </p>

                <div class = "pageFourImage">

                </div>

                <p>
                  Epic Games is trying to challenge the monopoly that Steam holds
                  over the distribution of PC Games by offering developers a better
                  profit margin in order to lure developers away from Steam and
                  have their games remain as Epic exclusives.
